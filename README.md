#Notifire
##Keep calm and get Notifire

A crowdsourcing app, where people can get notified of the location of an exisitng fire incident.
When you hear the fire truck siren what do you think of?

    There's a fire

and when... there's a fire we get curious! where's it at.
we go to facebook, ask around, maybe make some calls.

or maybe there a fire near you and you want to broadcast for others to know

so, what if the next time we hear a fire truck siren

we have the NOTIFIRE
